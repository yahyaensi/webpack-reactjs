# Setup Prettier

A tool that formats your JavaScript using Prettier followed by eslint --fix.
This tool infers the equivalent Prettier config options from your existing .eslintrc file.
npm install --save-dev prettier-eslint

This is the CLI tool that’ll help you run all of your files through prettier-eslint at once.
npm install --save-dev prettier-eslint-cli

A tool that formats CSS/SCSS with Prettier followed by stylelint —-fix.
This tool infers the equivalent Prettier config options from your existing .stylelintrc file.
Note that unlike prettier-eslint, you don’t have to install another package for its CLI since that is already included in it.
npm install --save-dev prettier-stylelint
